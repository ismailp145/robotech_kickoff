# Hangman Lite 🎯

Welcome to **Hangman Lite** – a terminal-based Python game where you guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Get it right before the robot gets fully assembled!

## 🧠 Description

This is a simplified version of the classic Hangman game, designed to be both fun and educational. It uses ASCII art to represent the hangman stages and a predefined list of tech-themed words.

## 🚀 Features

- Random word selection from a tech-themed list
- ASCII art for visual progress
- Input validation (no repeated or invalid guesses)
- Clean, structured game loop
- Beginner-friendly codebase

## 📦 Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the file:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-lite.git
   cd hangman-lite
   ```

2. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python hangman_lite.py
   ```

## 🧩 Gameplay

- You have 6 tries to guess the word.
- Input one letter per guess.
- The hangman graphic will evolve with each wrong guess.
- The game ends in a win if you guess all letters or a loss if you run out of tries.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Key Functions:

- `choose_secret_word()`: Randomly picks a word from a preset list.
- `display_progress()`: Shows your current progress and the hangman figure.
- `get_player_guess()`: Takes and validates the player’s input.
- `update_discovered()`: Reveals correct letters or deducts a try.

### Constants:

- `WORDS`: List of potential secret words.
- `MAX_TRIES`: Number of allowed incorrect guesses.
- `HANGMAN_STAGES`: ASCII visuals for each wrong guess.

## 🧪 Example Output

```text
Word: _ _ _ _ _
Misses remaining: 3
Guess a letter: o
Correct! The word so far: _ o _ _ _
```

## 🤓 Ideal For

- Beginner Python programmers
- Students practicing input validation, loops, and basic game logic
- Anyone who enjoys quick coding games

### 📁 `Spotify_Predictor/README.md`

```markdown
# Spotify Predictor 🎵

A machine learning project that predicts song characteristics or popularity metrics based on Spotify dataset features.

## 📊 Description

This project uses historical Spotify data to train a machine learning model capable of predicting song popularity, genre classification, or user preferences based on various audio features.

## 🔍 Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Visual data exploration with graphs
- Multiple ML model support (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
- Predictive analysis on unseen song data

## 🧠 Technologies

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project
If it's a notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Spotify_Predictor.ipynb
```

Or if it's a script-based pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📁 File Structure
```
Spotify_Predictor/
├── data/               # Raw and cleaned Spotify data
├── models/             # Saved models
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter Notebooks for exploration
├── utils/              # Helper functions
├── main.py             # Entry point (if script-based)
└── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
```

## 📈 Example Use Cases

- Predict the popularity of a new song
- Classify genre based on acoustic features
- Explore feature correlations like danceability vs. energy
